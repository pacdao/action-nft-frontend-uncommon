This frontend was deployed permanently to IPFS via Fleek for the first Action NFT sale: [https://orange-lake-2728.on.fleek.co/](https://orange-lake-2728.on.fleek.co/)

The associated smart contract was checked in to [https://github.com/pacdao/actionnft-backend](https://github.com/pacdao/actionnft-backend).  

![Common NFT](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/EaMqiaLdKLOYI96NzfRcDHTh_bzdp4EvW98kZRoo5k6WFV3ywh-bqjS81_cSL1Y3jdbHHN2DuxRRWD7u3jnN0liO2iTQ8hZfUpI_7g=w332)

The rare auction contract was deployed to [0xd56c12efd06252f1f0098a8fe517da286245c0a8](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd56c12efd06252f1f0098a8fe517da286245c0a8), allowing the top five bidders to receive the rare version of the NFT, with all else able to claim a refund after the resolution.

The common version was deployed to to [0xe60a7825a80509de847ffe30ce2936dfc770db6b](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe60a7825a80509de847ffe30ce2936dfc770db6b),
 issued with a cap of 3000 and a linear price ramp of .001 after each mint from a .005 floor price.
 
The Action is targeting the infrastructure bill, which contained irrelevant and damaging language about cryptocurrency.  The scored action is any politician who brings to floor vote an amendment to remove this language.  The conclusion is determined by the PAC DAO.

## Technical Details

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
